#File zipper using huffman coding
● This project is based on Huffman Coding, a lossless, bottom-up compression
algorithm. It can compress and decompress any text files.
● This project implements two functions,encode and decode.
● Also uses priority queue to implement min heap data structure to store data in the
form of nodes.
